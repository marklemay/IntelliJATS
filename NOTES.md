adding the parser definition makes the spelling warnings go away
* but adds errors
* how does a fancy plugin know when things are spell checkable?
  * possibly hard since the make file plugin doesn;t handle that
  
auto commenter annoyingly jumps lines
* this seems standard (the java plugin does it) perhaps there is a global setting that handles that somewhere

integrating with the clion pugin would be ideal, but it hasn't been released yet
